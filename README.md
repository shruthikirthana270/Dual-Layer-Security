 🔐 Dual-Layer Security Approach for Cloud Data  
 Using Cryptography and Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
With the rapid growth of cloud computing, data security has become a major concern. This project proposes a **Dual-Layer Security Model** that combines **Cryptography** and **Steganography** to ensure secure cloud data storage and transmission.

The data is first encrypted using cryptographic techniques and then hidden inside an image using steganography, providing **double protection** against unauthorized access.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure confidentiality of cloud data  
- Protect sensitive information from unauthorized users  
- Combine encryption and data hiding for enhanced security  
- Secure data before uploading to the cloud  


## 🔒 Security Layers Used
### 1️⃣ Cryptography
- Encrypts the original data  
- Prevents attackers from understanding the content  
- Ensures data confidentiality  

### 2️⃣ Steganography
- Hides encrypted data inside an image  
- Makes data invisible to attackers  
- Adds an extra layer of security  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Cryptography Techniques:** AES / RSA (based on implementation)  
- **Steganography:** Image-based data hiding  
- **Cloud Storage:** Any standard cloud platform  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub  



## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. User selects a file to upload  
2. File is encrypted using cryptography  
3. Encrypted data is embedded inside an image (steganography)  
4. Secured image is uploaded to the cloud  
5. Reverse process is used for data retrieval  


## ✅ Advantages
- Double-layer protection  
- High data confidentiality  
- Resistant to common cyber attacks  
- Suitable for sensitive cloud data
